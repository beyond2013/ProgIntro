# Stack rolling and unrolling

In the context of C programming, "stack rolling" and "stack unrolling" usually refer to the process of managing the function call stack during program execution, particularly in relation to function calls and returns. 

1. **Stack Rolling (Pushing onto the Stack):**
   - When a function is called in C, space is allocated on the call stack to store information related to the function call, such as local variables, parameters, return addresses, and sometimes the state of the calling function (such as the value of the stack pointer).
   - This process of pushing information onto the stack for the current function call is often referred to as "stack rolling". It involves adjusting the stack pointer to make room for the new function's stack frame and storing the necessary information in that frame.

2. **Stack Unrolling (Popping from the Stack):**
   - Once a function completes its execution and returns a value (if it's not a void function), the information related to that function call is removed from the stack to free up space.
   - This process of removing information from the stack after a function call completes is known as "stack unrolling". It involves adjusting the stack pointer to release the memory occupied by the function's stack frame, restoring the state of the calling function (such as the stack pointer), and returning control to the caller.

The sequence of stack rolling and unrolling occurs automatically as functions are called and return in C programs, managed by the compiler and runtime environment. This process ensures that the program's execution flow is correctly maintained and that memory is efficiently utilized.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int result;
    // Function call
    result = add(3, 5);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    // Stack rolling: allocating space for function call
    // Local variables a and b are stored on the stack
    int sum = a + b;
    // Stack unrolling: releasing space after function call completes
    return sum;
}
```

In this example, when the `add()` function is called from `main()`, space is allocated on the stack for the function's local variables (`a` and `b`). After the function completes execution and returns the sum, the space allocated for `add()`'s stack frame is released (stack unrolling).
