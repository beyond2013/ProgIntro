# Lists and their memory organization

- List or linked list is a dynamic data structure
- It consists of a sequence of nodes
- Each node contains / stores data and pointer to the next node.
- List data structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements
- Another advantage is dynamic memory allocation.

![example of a linked list](../figs/linked-list.png "Example of a linked list")

- Head points to the first node of the list, if it is NULL the list is considered empty
- The pointer of the last node also contains NULL to indicate the end of the list
- All the	nodes of linked list are stored
