# Lists and their memory organization

- List or linked list is a dynamic data structure
- It consists of a sequence of nodes
- Each node contains / stores data and pointer to the next node.
- List data structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements
- Another advantage is dynamic memory allocation.
