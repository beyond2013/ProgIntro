# Fundamentals of Programming A to Z

- The idea behind A to Z of a computing course is to provide bite size information in alphabetic order.
- Since many terms describing a concept can start with a letter e.g. Data types starts with D, Dynamic memory allocation also starts with a D, only one of the terms will be covered in a series
- Such bite size information is key in starting to understand a topic, writing one liners to answer short questions or even interview questions, and revising a course after a long break to prepare for a comprehensive exam.

A for Algorithm, Arguments, Arrays
B for Branching Statements (break, continue, return, goto), Boolean
C for Compiling, Constants, Comments, Conditionals(if, if-else, switch)
D for Data type, Dynamic Memory Allocation
E for Expressions (Mathematical, Logical, Relational)
F for Functions, Files
G for
H for
I for IDEs
J for 
K for
L for Linker, Loader , Loops(Repetition), Literals
M for 
N for Nesting
O for Operators(their precedence)
P for Pseudocode, Preprocessor, Pointers, Parameters
Q for
R for
S for Strings, Static, Structures, Streams(input/output)
T for Ternary Operator, Testing
U for Unions
V for Variables 
W for
X for
Y for
Z for
