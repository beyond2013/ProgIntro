# Introduction to problem Solving

- Humans have the ability to solve complex problems.
- Solving problems usually involves calculations and making decisions in an orderly manner.
- Every tool that we use today is the solution of a problem someone solved years ago.
	- e.g. counting things, a system is needed to count things, different systems were used to represent the count of things. e.g. Roman numerals which originated in ancient Rome. Examples of roman numbers, the number 4 is written as IV, five is written as V. To know more about Roman numerals [visit this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)  
	- Try to write 543 in Roman numerals, you will realize that using this system is not easy, how about adding two 4 digit numbers written in Roman numerals? Can you guess what number is MCM?  
	- Limitations and problems identified in one solution can help in making the existing solution better, and sometimes give way to invent one or more better solution.  
	- Arabic numerals that we use nowadays made counting things easier. Compare adding 2 four digits numbers in Arabic and Roman numerals and you will get a better idea.

- It is also important to note that for a single problem more than one solutions may exist.
- In order to solve a problem, one must understand what the problem is. 
- A problem can be expressed by describing it in words.
- In mathematics and computational sciences problems are usually expressed by writing symbols.
- The process of finding a solution and the quality of the solution is dependent on how accurately the problem has been expressed.

## Role of computers in problem solving

- Humans are intelligent beings but have some limitations.
- One of the limitations is the amount of calculations a human can carryout in a given time.
- Another limitation is the speed with which calculations are done.
- Yet another limitation is accuracy.
- This is where computers can help, computers can perform huge calculations with speed and accuracy.

## Role of programming language in problem solving

- In order to solve a problem using computer one has to express the problem and its solution in a language computer can understand.
- Many computer programming languages exist, and C is one of them. 
- C language is popular and well known because one of the famous open source operating system Linux has been written in C language. 

## Related points 
- Problems and solutions to problems existed before computers or programming languages were invented.
- Keen observation and analyzing a problem is important in developing solution to problems.
- Languages we use to communicate with each other can not be used to communicate with computers.
- Programming languages are used to solve computational problems.
- Programming languages may be general purpose e.g. C++, Java, Ruby, Python, or may be targeted at solving problems in a specific area for example Fortran or MATLAB.
