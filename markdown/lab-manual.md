  3. Write a program to search for a student record by roll number from a file.

## Lab 9: Preprocessor Directives and Macros
- **Aim:** To understand preprocessor directives and macros in C programming.

- **Exercises:**
  1. Write a program to demonstrate the use of `#define` directive to define constants.
  2. Write a program to demonstrate conditional compilation using `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, and `#endif` directives.
  3. Write a program to demonstrate the use of macros for performing mathematical operations.

## Lab 10: Advanced Concepts
