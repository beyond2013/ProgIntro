# Repetitive statements and execution flow for repetitive statements

**Explanation of the topic below was generated using openai in response to the question: how to explain the need of repetitive statements in programming language to a beginner**

Imagine you have a task that you need to repeat over and over again, like counting from 1 to 10. In programming, repetitive statements, often called loops, help us automate such tasks. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, we can use loops to execute a set of instructions repeatedly without having to duplicate the code.

Loops allow us to save time and effort by letting the computer do the repetitive work for us. They are like a super helpful assistant that follows our instructions and performs the same action multiple times.

For example, let's say you want to print the numbers from 1 to 10. Instead of writing ten separate print statements, you can use a loop to achieve the same result with just a few lines of code. The loop will iterate over a range of numbers, and each time it goes through the loop, it will execute the same set of instructions.

By using loops, we can also process large amounts of data more efficiently. For instance, if we have a list of 100 names and we want to perform an action on each name, we can use a loop to iterate through the list and execute the action for each item.

Loops come in different forms, but they all serve the purpose of repeating code. The two most common types of loops are the 'for' loop and the 'while' loop. The 'for' loop is typically used when we know the number of iterations in advance, while the 'while' loop is useful when we want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.

So, in summary, repetitive statements or loops in programming are essential because they allow us to automate tasks, save time, and process large amounts of data efficiently. They enable us to avoid writing duplicate code and make our programs more concise and powerful."

Sample programs using for, while, and do while loops:

[for loop](../src/for.c)
[while loop](../src/while.c)
[do while loop](../src/dowhile.c)
