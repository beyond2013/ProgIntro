# Fundamentals of Programming

## BSCS - 2022-2026 (Morning)

## Checking if a number is prime or not

**Due date: 16 July 2023**

Write a program in c language. The behavior of the program should be as described below:

- asks the user to input a number between 2 and 100.
- If the user inputs a number out of this range the program should display "number out of range, press 1 to try again".
- If the user presses 1 the program should again ask the user to input a number between 2 and 100
- if the user enters a number between 2 and 100, the program should call a function	`isprime()` 
- the function `isprime()` should return 1 if the number is prime, otherwise 0

**After you have written and tested your program. Mention your complete name, father's name and roll number as comments in c program.**

**Guidelines for submitting assignment**

- create your github account
- create a repo `assignment`
- upload your c program to github repo `assignment`
- email the link to your github repo to me [my official email](imranali@um.uob.edu.pk)
