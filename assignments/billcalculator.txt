Consuming more utility such as Gas and Electricity in developing countries results in higher bills. 

Suppose a utility provider charges a consumer with the following rates:
1. 3 Rupees per unit if the consumption is between 0 to 100 units
2. 4 Rupees for every unit consumed between 101 to 200 units
3. 5 Rupees for every units consumed between 201 to 300 units.

Write a c program which asks the consumer to enter the number of units consumed. and calculate the amount of bill.

e.g.

1.
Enter the amount of units consumed	100
You have to pay 300 Rupees

2.
Enter the amount of units consumed	150
You have to pay 500 Rupees

3. 
Enter the amount of units consumed	250
You have to pay 950 Rupees
